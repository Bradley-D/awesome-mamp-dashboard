# Awesome MAMP Dashboard
A better dashboard for those times you need to use MAMP.

Sometimes I need to use MAMP (the free edition) for PHP and WordPress development and I wanted a better dashboard once I clicked on "My Websites" from the MAMP start page, so here it is.

## What Does This Do?
The index file replaces the index.php file that is the MAMP htdocs folder.

## How To Use
- Download this index.php file
- Go to your MAMP folder and open the htdocs folder
- Rename the index.php that you find in the htdocs folder to something like, index-original.php
- Put the index.php file you downloaded from Github in the MAMP htdocs folder
- That's it.

Now when you start MAMP, go to the "Start Page" and click "My Website" fro mthe menu and you will now see the new dashboard.

## But I Don't Like It, Give Me The Original One Back
Ok, calm down skipper. You know how you renamed the original index file from the htdocs to index-original.php, just rename it again back to index.php and you have the original back. Stay calm and get your code on.

## Notes
- This file does not check for the language like the original file so please fork this file and make any language changes you need.
- I gave myself a link credit in the footer of the dashboard, keep it, delete it, it is up to you.
